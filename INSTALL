This software is an alpha development version and not representative of the quality or features of the full product.

The software has been tested on a CentOS 7 server, and is the recommended operating system at this time. You may have luck installing on your favorite flavor of Linux as well. This software has been tested against an on-premise enterprise Lastline installation.

Software requirements (Tested with):
  yum:
    epel-repository => 7.5 
    httpd/apache => 2.4.6-19
    mod_wsgi => 3.4-12
    python-pip => 1.5.6.5
    policycoreutils-python => 2.2.5-15
  pip:
    django => 1.7.5
    requests => 2.5.3
    dill => 0.2.2
    django-request-provider => 1.0.2
    django-ipware => 0.1.0 

Other requirements:
  An admin level account is required on Lastline manager. The username and password of the account are used to login to the Lastline API to make changes.

Steps for installation:

The following should be performed as the 'root' user. Lines prefixed by a '#' character are to be typed into a shell. RPM packaging is in plans to be provided at a later date.

1. Install required repositories, Apache webserver and libraries.
# yum update && yum install epel-release
# yum update && yum install httpd mod_ssl mod_wsgi python-pip policycoreutils-python
# pip install django requests dill django-request-provider django-ipware
# systemctl enable httpd.service

2. Save this software under /opt/lastline_api
# cp -r <this directory> /opt/lastline_api

3. Configure Apache virtualhost as per example in:
/opt/lastline_api/config/apache/lastline_api.conf.example
Note: This is only an example, it is not designed to be used directly. Be sure to change your configuration to match your needs. 

4. Configure lastline_api with the access credentials to your Lastline installation
# cp /opt/lastline_api/config/papi_client.ini.example /opt/lastline_api/config/papi_client.ini
Edit the papi_client.ini fields: url, username, password

This should correspond to your Lastline manager servers information. The user should be one with admin rights on the Lastline manager. Note that the url must end '/papi'. Note: CA verification is not yet supported at this time.

5. Edit the '/opt/lastline_api/lastline_api/settings.py' file

It is necessary to change the 'SECRET_KEY' for any production environment. Example:
SECRET_KEY = 'ThisShouldBeALongStringOfRandomCharacters'

You should also set your timezone. Example:
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Helsinki'

The other settings should be fine with the defaults.

6. Create the sqlite database and superuser
# /opt/lastline_api/manage.py migrate
# /opt/lastline_api/manage.py createsuperuser

7. Collect static files to '/opt/lastline_api/static' directory to be served
# /opt/lastline_api/manage.py collectstatic
Note: You can either host these static files directly from the server, or move them over to a CDN. In the latter case you will need to edit 'STATIC_URL' in '/opt/lastline_api/lastline_api/settings.py' accordingly.

8. Ensure correct permissions and SELinux context for the installation
# chown -R root:root /opt/lastline_api
# chown apache: /opt/lastline_api /opt/lastline_api/db.sqlite3
# semanage fcontext -a -t "httpd_sys_content_t" "/opt/lastline_api(/.*)?"
# semanage fcontext -a -t "httpd_sys_rw_content_t" "/opt/lastline_api"
# semanage fcontext -a -t "httpd_sys_rw_content_t" "/opt/lastline_api/db.sqlite3"
# restorecon -rv /opt/lastline_api

9. Restart Apache
# systemctl restart httpd

10. Start using Lastline Web API
User interface: https://<server address/
Admin interface: https://<server address>/admin


Notes on the admin interface:

- Login by using the superuser you created earlier.
- New users can be created through the admin interface.
- New users get basic access rights by default and cannot login to the admin interface.
- Add the user 'Staff status' if you wish them to be able to login into the admin interface and make changes.
- Changing your password is possible through the admin interface.
- Groups are not used for anything at this time.
